## Technical Aspects

This project uses **Java with Quarkus**. So, although it is not required for you to already have experience with this stack specifically, experience with other modern Java stack like Spring (Boot) based ones would be required.

## Commiting and PR guidelines

1. We recommend using https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ for the commit messages. You don't need to be strict to it, but that's a good reference.

1. Remember to reference the **issue** you are working on your commit messages, like `git commit -a -m "<your_commit_message>. refs #8"`
